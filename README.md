# vehicle-trajectories-project
Looking into vehicle trajectory data, lane changes etc

This project is looking into visualising and quantifying vehicle trajectory available from https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Vehicle-Trajector/8ect-6jqj


The Peachtree data has been found to have a error in the "Global_Time" variable so analysis is going to change to a different area until this has been sorted out - see the "data munging" script  for how the error was found.
